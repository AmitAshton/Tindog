Hey
Im creating a tindog app - tinder for dogs using MERN Stack:
node.js + express.js
mongoose
react.js

my app has users and each user has a status:
1. selling a dog.
2. giving a dog.
3. buying a dog.
4. adopting a dog.
5. loking for a dogisitter(someone who will take care of your dog while you are not available)
6. dogisitter(people who sign to the app in order to find job oppertunites for dogsitting)

Some important points about the app:

1. friends:
people who buy a dog will have the oppertunity to scroll in the app between all the dog sellers and see the dog details, in order to find a match
people who sell a dog will wait for people who buy a dog to be intrested in thier dog
once there is a match, they will be friends

Accordingly, people who adopt a dog will have the oppertunity to scroll in the app between all the dog givers and see the dog details, in order to find a match
people who give a dog will wait for people who adopt a dog to be intrested in thier dog
once there is a match, they will be friends

Accordingly, people who are looking for a dogisitter will have the oppertunity to scroll in the app between all the dogisitters and see thier details, in order to find a match
people who are dogisitters will wait for people who are looking for a dogisitter to be intrested in thier dog
once there is a match, they will be friends


im stuck with the database models and schema using mongoose

i want my database to have all this:

every user have:
1. username - string, required

2. password - string, required

3. geographical location - location, required

4. friends - array of other users which the current user matched with, at first empty array

5. Status - string, required

According to the status, i want to have another fields:

If status is "selling a dog":
5. price - int, required(selling price)
6. dogName - string, required
7. dogBreed - string, required
8. dogAge - int, required
9. images - images(i dont know how to add this to a mongoose schema), at least one required

If status is "giving a dog":
5. dogName - string, required
6. dogBreed - string, required
7. dogAge - int, required
8. images - images(i dont know how to add this to a mongoose schema), at least one required

If status is "buying a dog":
5. price - int, required(buying price approximately, used for giving the client a proper results filtered by price)
6. dogBreed - string, required(wanted breed for the dog)

If status is "adopting a dog":
5. dogBreed - string, required(wanted breed for the dog)

If status is "loking for a dogisitter":
5. dogName - string, required
6. dogBreed - string, required
7. images - images(i dont know how to add this to a mongoose schema), at least one required

If status is "dogisitter":
5. pricePerHour - int, required
6. personImage - image(i dont know how to add this to a mongoose schema,
        but every dogsitter must have one image of himself(the person) so people would be able to see who they choose to dogsitting thier dog)

אני לא יכול למחוק משתמש שאין לו אובייקט לפי סטטוס
כלומר בכל יצירת משתמש צריך ליצור גם את האובייקטים המתאימים לפי הססטוס
כלומר כשהמשתמש יוצר חשבון, צריך ליצור לו גם אובייקטים מתאימים לפי הסטטוס
כלומר בנוסף לטופס ההצטרפות, יש ליצור גם טופס לפי הסטטוס על מנת ליצור אובייקטים מתאימים

For your Tindog app, which includes user matching, chat functionality, and role-based interactions, you'll need a stack that ensures scalability, real-time communication, and a smooth user experience. Below is a recommendation for a full stack solution:

Front-End:
React Native (Mobile App)
Why: Cross-platform mobile development (iOS and Android) using JavaScript. It's perfect for delivering a smooth user interface and native-like performance.
Features:
Easy to integrate with third-party libraries.
Large community and plugin ecosystem.
Reusable components across platforms.
Expo (Optional, if React Native)
Why: Expo can simplify the development process, especially for building prototypes or MVPs. It includes built-in features such as push notifications, camera access, and easier deployment.
Features:
Simplifies app testing and deployment.
Can be detached later for custom native code when needed.
Back-End:
Node.js with Express
Why: Node.js is lightweight and handles asynchronous operations well, which is crucial for real-time communication and handling large-scale connections. Express makes routing and middleware easy.
Features:
JavaScript-based, making it easy to share code between the front and back end.
Strong real-time support (needed for chat and matching features).
Socket.IO
Why: Real-time communication is essential for private chats and instant notifications when matches occur.
Features:
Allows bi-directional communication between clients and servers.
Can handle rooms, broadcasting, and multiple chat participants.
Database:
MongoDB (NoSQL)
Why: MongoDB can handle semi-structured data, making it perfect for flexible user profiles, dog details, and different user statuses.
Features:
Easy to scale.
Built-in support for document-based models, which fits well for a dynamic schema (dog profiles, user preferences, etc.).
Redis (Optional for caching and session management)
Why: To improve the performance of frequently accessed data (like user profiles or chat messages) and for session management in Socket.IO.
Authentication & Authorization:
JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
Why: For secure, stateless user authentication and authorization, especially if you're dealing with role-based access control.
Features:
Compatible with mobile apps and APIs.
Easy to implement on both the client and server.
Cloud & Hosting:
AWS or Google Cloud (EC2 or Firebase for real-time features)
Why: AWS EC2 offers flexibility, scalability, and reliable hosting services. Firebase is also a good option if you want ready-made solutions for real-time database and authentication.
Features:
AWS: Elastic, scalable backend for hosting your server and database.
Firebase: Great for real-time data sync (chat, notifications), cloud storage, and authentication.
S3 (for image storage)
Why: You'll need to store user and dog images. AWS S3 is reliable, scalable, and secure for media storage.
Features:
Fast retrieval and storage of images.
Low cost for media-heavy apps.
Real-Time Chat & Notifications:
Socket.IO (for real-time chat)
Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) (for push notifications)
Why: Push notifications are essential for informing users of new messages or match alerts.
Features:
Real-time notifications across devices.
Other Tools:
Stripe or PayPal SDK (Optional)
Why: If you want to add payment options for dog-sitting services.
Features:
Easy to integrate with React Native and Node.js.
SendGrid or Mailgun (Optional for email notifications)
Why: For email notifications when a match occurs or for system messages.
Features:
Scalable and simple API for sending transactional emails.
Summary Stack:
Front-end: React Native + Expo (for mobile app)
Back-end: Node.js with Express + Socket.IO (for real-time features)
Database: MongoDB (for flexible data structure) + Redis (for caching & session)
Cloud: AWS EC2 or Firebase (for hosting and real-time functionality)
Storage: AWS S3 (for image uploads)
Authentication: JWT (for user authentication)
Chat: Socket.IO (for real-time chat)
Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging (for push notifications)
This stack provides flexibility, scalability, and real-time communication, which are key for your Tindog app. It will allow you to match users effectively and handle chat and notification features seamlessly.
